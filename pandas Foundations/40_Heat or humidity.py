# In this exercise, you will explore the maximum temperature and dew point of each month. The columns of interest are 'dew_point_faren' and 'dry_bulb_faren'. After resampling them appropriately to get the maximum temperature and dew point in each month, generate a histogram of these values as subplots. Uncomfortably, you will notice that the maximum dew point is above 65 every month!

# df_clean has been pre-loaded for you.

# Resample dew_point_faren and dry_bulb_faren by Month, aggregating the maximum values: monthly_max
monthly_max = df_clean[['dew_point_faren',
                        'dry_bulb_faren']].resample('M').max()

# Generate a histogram with bins=8, alpha=0.5, subplots=True
monthly_max.plot(kind='hist', bins=8, alpha=0.5, subplots=True)

# Show the plot
plt.show()
