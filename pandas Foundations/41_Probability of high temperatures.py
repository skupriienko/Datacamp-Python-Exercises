# We already know that 2011 was hotter than the climate normals for the previous thirty years. In this final exercise, you will compare the maximum temperature in August 2011 against that of the August 2010 climate normals. More specifically, you will use a CDF plot to determine the probability of the 2011 daily maximum temperature in August being above the 2010 climate normal value. To do this, you will leverage the data manipulation, filtering, resampling, and visualization skills you have acquired throughout this course.

# The two DataFrames df_clean and df_climate are available in the workspace. Your job is to select the maximum temperature in August in df_climate, and then maximum daily temperatures in August 2011. You will then filter to keep only the days in August 2011 that were above the August 2010 maximum, and use this to construct a CDF plot.

# Once you've generated the CDF, notice how it shows that there was a 50% probability of the 2011 daily maximum temperature in August being 5 degrees above the 2010 climate normal value!

# Extract the maximum temperature in August 2010 from df_climate: august_max
august_max = df_climate.loc['2010-Aug','Temperature'].max()
print(august_max)

# Resample August 2011 temps in df_clean by day & aggregate the max value: august_2011
august_2011 = df_clean.loc['2011-Aug','dry_bulb_faren'].resample('D').max()

# Filter for days in august_2011 where the value exceeds august_max: august_2011_high
august_2011_high = august_2011.loc[august_2011 > august_max]

# Construct a CDF of august_2011_high
august_2011_high.plot(kind='hist', normed=True, cumulative=True, bins=25)

# Display the plot
plt.show()
