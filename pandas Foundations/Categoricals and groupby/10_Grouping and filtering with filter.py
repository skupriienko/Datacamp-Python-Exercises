# First, you'll identify how many units each company bought for verification. Next you'll use the .filter() method after grouping by 'Company' to remove all rows belonging to companies whose sum over the 'Units' column was less than or equal to 35. Finally, verify that the three companies whose total Units purchased were less than or equal to 35 have been filtered out from the DataFrame.

# Read the CSV file into a DataFrame: sales
sales = pd.read_csv('sales.csv', index_col='Date', parse_dates=True)

# Group sales by 'Company': by_company
by_company = sales.groupby('Company')

# Compute the sum of the 'Units' of by_company: by_com_sum
by_com_sum = by_company['Units'].sum()
print(by_com_sum)

# Filter 'Units' where the sum is > 35: by_com_filt
by_com_filt = by_company.filter(lambda g: g['Units'].sum() > 35)
print(by_com_filt)
