# In this exercise your job is to investigate survival rates of passengers on the Titanic by 'age' and 'pclass'. In particular, the goal is to find out what fraction of children under 10 survived in each 'pclass'. You'll do this by first creating a boolean array where True is passengers under 10 years old and False is passengers over 10. You'll use .map() to change these values to strings. Finally, you'll group by the under 10 series and the 'pclass' column and aggregate the 'survived' column. The 'survived' column has the value 1 if the passenger survived and 0 otherwise. The mean of the 'survived' column is the fraction of passengers who lived. The DataFrame has been pre-loaded for you as titanic.

# Create the Boolean Series: under10
under10 = (titanic['age'] < 10).map({True: 'under 10', False: 'over 10'})

# Group by under10 and compute the survival rate
survived_mean_1 = titanic.groupby(under10)['survived'].mean()
print(survived_mean_1)

# Group by under10 and pclass and compute the survival rate
survived_mean_2 = titanic.groupby([under10, 'pclass'])['survived'].mean()
print(survived_mean_2)
