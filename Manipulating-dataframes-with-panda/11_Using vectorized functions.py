# In this exercise you're going to import the zscore function from scipy.stats and use it to compute the deviation in voter turnout in Pennsylvania from the mean in fractions of the standard deviation. In statistics, the z-score is the number of standard deviations by which an observation is above the mean - so if it is negative, it means the observation is below the mean. Instead of using .apply() as you did in the earlier exercises, the zscore UFunc will take a pandas Series as input and return a NumPy array. You will then assign the values of the NumPy array to a new column in the DataFrame. You will be working with the election DataFrame - it has been pre-loaded for you.

# Import zscore from scipy.stats
from scipy.stats import zscore

# Call zscore with election['turnout'] as input: turnout_zscore
turnout_zscore = zscore(election['turnout'])

# Print the type of turnout_zscore
print(type(turnout_zscore))

# Assign turnout_zscore to a new column: election['turnout_zscore']
election['turnout_zscore'] = turnout_zscore

# Print the output of election.head()
print(election.head())
